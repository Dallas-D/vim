# vim
For my .vimrc

## Set Up

### Vim (terminal-based cases)

Move `.vim` to the home directory. Make the directories `undo`, `backup`, and
`swp` within `.vim` to make sure meta files can be saved separately.  

*TODO: create a function to autocreate the directories*

### GVim (Windows use cases)

Move `vimfiles` to the user home directory (`C:\Users\%USER%\`)

## Theme

I currently use the [One Half](https://github.com/sonph/onehalf/tree/master/vim)
theme. I previously used the
[PaperColor](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) but I still save it
for certain cases. Both `.vim` files are duplicated here for quick access.

## Features

### Distraction-Free / Focus Mode
